        ○ The concept of proximity in design emphasizes that elements which are related to
        one another should be grouped together, while elements that are unrelated or serve
        different purposes should be spaced farther apart. Proper use of proximity helps
        users figure out the relationship between different components on the page,
        making for a much smoother navigational experience. Proximity also
        demonstrates and helps establish a visual hierarchy that guides the reader’s
        through the site.
        ○ Improper use of proximity, such as using equal or haphazard spacing for all
        elements, without a clear hierarchy established can leave users confused.
        Disorganized content will cause viewers to struggle to understand which elements
        are related to one another. If users find the layout disorganized, they may lose
        interest quickly, abandon your site, and go to an alternative that offers a more
        intuitive design.
        ○ Proximity contributes to aesthetics, digestibility of the content, and by extension,
        a positive user experience. This essential design concept applies to text, images,
        videos, buttons, and all other elements on the page. Proximity proves time and
        time again to be an important tool at a web developer's disposal
