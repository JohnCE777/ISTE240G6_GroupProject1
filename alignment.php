        ○ Alignment refers to the intentional arrangement of elements in a design to make
        visually appealing and harmonious layouts. Making sure that the elements on a
        page are properly aligned helps guide the user’s attention across the site. This
        directs their attention to the most important parts of the site and creates a logical
        flow from one part to the next, reinforcing navigational clarity. Alignment applies
        to text, images, and all other content the user sees when visiting the site. This
        concept goes hand in hand with repetition by contributing to a clean and
        structured look.
        ○ Aside from the functional benefits of proper alignment plays a crucial role in
        conveying professionalism and attention to detail. A site with logically aligned
        elements feels polished and cohesive. This aids in the building of trust with the
        user. Poor alignment, on the other hand often leads to a disorganized appearance
        that detracts from the user experience, making the interface feel unprofessional
        and haphazard. By aligning elements in a thoughtful and consistent manner,
        designers improve the visual presentation of the site helping with both usability
        and the overall aesthetic of the site.
        ○ According to David Zheng, a writer for the Daily Egg, a web analytics company,
        when users visit a website, they will leave if the content has not piqued their
        interest enough within 15 seconds. This is known as the 15 second rule. If users
        are greeted with an insurmountable wall of center aligned text, it is unlikely that
        they will stay for long. A website is pointless if nobody stays long enough to read
        and understand the content.
