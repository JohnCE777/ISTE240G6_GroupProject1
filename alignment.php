                    <h1>Alignment</h1> 
                    <p>
                        Alignment refers to the intentional arrangement of elements in a design to 
                        make visually appealing and harmonious layouts. Making sure that the elements 
                        on a page are properly aligned helps guide the user’s attention across the 
                        site. This directs their attention to the most important parts of the site 
                        and creates a logical flow from one part to the next, reinforcing navigational 
                        clarity. Alignment applies to text, images, and all other content the user 
                        sees when visiting the site. This concept goes hand in hand with repetition 
                        by contributing to a clean and structured look.

                        Aside from the functional benefits of proper alignment plays a crucial role 
                        in conveying professionalism and attention to detail. A site with logically 
                        aligned elements feels polished and cohesive. This aids in the building of 
                        trust with the user. Poor alignment, on the other hand often leads to a 
                        disorganized appearance that detracts from the user experience, making the 
                        interface feel unprofessional and haphazard. By aligning elements in a 
                        thoughtful and consistent manner, designers improve the visual presentation 
                        of the site helping with both usability and the overall aesthetic of the site.

                According to David Zheng, a writer for the Daily Egg, a web analytics company, when 
                users visit a website, they will leave if the content has not piqued their interest 
                enough within 15 seconds. This is known as the 15 second rule. If users are greeted 
                with an insurmountable wall of center aligned text, it is unlikely that they will 
                stay for long. A website is pointless if nobody stays long enough to read and 
                understand the content.
