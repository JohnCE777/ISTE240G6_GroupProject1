                <h1>The Crap Principles</h1>
                <p>
                    Defined by American author and educator Robin Patricia Williams in her 1994 work The Non-Designer’s
                    Design Book, the amusingly named CRAP design principles have since become ubiquitous among designers
                    across all media, from websites, to applications, to books and magazines. While the typical user may
                    browse a website or open an app without ever stopping to notice how its format and presentation affect
                    their view of the information it provides, it is undeniable that design influences our impressions of
                    these media almost instantaneously. Well designed web-pages draw the user’s eye instinctively to the
                    most important content, guide them effortlessly from one section to the next, and make it easy for them
                    to retain everything they see, all without the user ever being aware of it.
