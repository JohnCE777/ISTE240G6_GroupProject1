        ○ Repetition refers to the strategic use of recurring design elements throughout the
        site to establish a consistent, cohesive experience for visitors. By repeating visual
        and structural components, such as colors, fonts, shapes, and patterns, a sense of
        familiarity is created, which helps users navigate the site more easily. Repetition
        adds to an intuitive experience and design that contributes to a professional
        appearance that encourages user engagement and trust.

        ○ This practice not only improves the user experience by making the interface more
        consistent, but it also reinforces brand identity. Every repeated element acts as a
        subtle reminder of the company/organization’s design, building a stronger
        connection between the user and the brand. Solidifying brand identity is an
        important part of having a lasting impression on users, making you recognizable
        against competitors.
