        <p>Crap is an slang word for excrement. It is also an acronym that stands for:
            <ul>
                <li><span class="acronymLetter">C</span>ontrast</li>
                <li><span class="acronymLetter">R</span>epetition</li>
                <li><span class="acronymLetter">A</span>llignment</li>
                <li><span class="acronymLetter">P</span>roximity</li>
            </ul>
            These design priciples serve as a guide to make websites that are both easier to navigate
            and visually appealing. Robin Patricia Williams introduced CRAP in her book, The Non-Designer's Design Book
            which was published in 2011. Since the book's publication, the CRAP principles have become a standard on the web.
