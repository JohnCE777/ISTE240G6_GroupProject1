        About This Site
        ○ Front-end designers are responsible for a great deal more than simply ensuring
        that a website is visually appealing. Users’ attention to, retention of, and interest
        in the content a site has to offer are all influenced by a site's appearance first, and
        to a greater extent than by any other factor, and while most users probably aren't
        even aware of what decisions drive them to engage with a website, even the least
        technically experienced visitor can tell at a glance if a site is poorly designed, and
        more often than not, won’t give it the benefit of the doubt. As more and more
        13
        information is migrated from physical media to digital, therefore, the influence
        held by designers over what content users see and engage with is growing at an
        exponential rate. In order to make the best use of this power, designers need to be
        equipped with a set of guiding principles to ensure that the sites they create are
        both as engaging and as accessible as possible.
        ○ The aim of this site is to provide both experienced and beginning designers with a
        reference source for one such set of guidelines — the CRAP principles. Given
        how visual of a medium web-design is, designers can benefit from not only an
        understanding of the CRAP principles, but also a plethora of visual examples,
        both constructed and taken from the real world, of how they can be implemented
        to great effect. By compiling such examples, alongside education material
        concerning each of the principles, as well as information about accessible design
        best practices, therefore, this site endeavors to provide the necessary resources for
        designers of all levels — whether that be an introduction to the principles
        themselves, a refresher on how best to apply them, or just a repository of
        examples on which to base a project. All great designers borrow, after all!
