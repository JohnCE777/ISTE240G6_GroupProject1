        <p>
            Front-end designers are responsible for a great deal more than simply ensuring
            that a website is visually appealing. Users’ attention to, retention of, and interest
            in the content a site has to offer are all influenced by a site's appearance first, and
            to a greater extent than by any other factor, and while most users probably aren't
            even aware of what decisions drive them to engage with a website, even the least
            technically experienced visitor can tell at a glance if a site is poorly designed, and
            more often than not, won’t give it the benefit of the doubt. As more and more
            information is migrated from physical media to digital, therefore, the influence
            held by designers over what content users see and engage with is growing at an
            exponential rate. In order to make the best use of this power, designers need to be
            equipped with a set of guiding principles to ensure that the sites they create are
            both as engaging and as accessible as possible.

            The aim of this site is to provide both experienced and beginning designers with a
            reference source for one such set of guidelines — the CRAP principles. Given
            how visual of a medium web-design is, designers can benefit from not only an
            understanding of the CRAP principles, but also a plethora of visual examples,
            both constructed and taken from the real world, of how they can be implemented
            to great effect. By compiling such examples, alongside education material
            concerning each of the principles, as well as information about accessible design
            best practices, therefore, this site endeavors to provide the necessary resources for
            designers of all levels — whether that be an introduction to the principles
            themselves, a refresher on how best to apply them, or just a repository of
            examples on which to base a project. All great designers borrow, after all!
